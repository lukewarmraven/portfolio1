It was one of the first milestones that our research group ever had since we started doing this capstone research. It is already an honor to be recognized in the research space, what more it was to participate in competitions about the one thing that you're working hard so much for. This competition became a stepping stone for many great things that I got to experience for this project.",

This is an important workshop for me as it opened my horizons on what I can do more on web development as an aspiring developer and complete beginner. This is where I took my baby steps in learning React and Javascript, and it’s all been history since. And now, React JS is now my most proficient skill in my skillset.",
