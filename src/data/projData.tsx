At its core, it aims to highlight the vulnerable population in times of disaster, enhancing rescue coordination on those who need it the most. With RESBAC, the disaster preparedness and response increases by shining visibility on the person’s vulnerability. The barangay rescuers are grouped accordingly by available teams and dispersed among closest locations for better rescue designation, so they will know what to prepare before mobilizing to the location. \nThe RESBAC has an admin website, containing all essential tabs like the home maps and requests, dashboard, rescue list, alerts, and more. While the user has a mobile application where they can send requests and call for help, receive alerts, and have knowledge on the necessary disaster essentials in the emergency guide portion.",

I am hoping to be able to do more things like this in the future.",
